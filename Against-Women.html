      <h1>Crimes Against Women</h1>

    <div class="">
      <p class="p1">The difference between a man and a woman has certainly taken a form of a monster which is now feeding on the female strata of society. There would be no women in India if we do not act now. The National Crime Records Bureau has recently published the figures of crimes against women. Acc to the figures 100 women are subjected to rape each day approximately. The most numbers are in the state of Madhya Pradesh. In M.P. there is a rise of 358% in rape against women during 2013-14 i.e., 14 crimes each day. On the other side Uttar Pradesh excels in murder and kidnapping of which 300 murders were due to love affairs. Delhi excels in theft. In India nearly 2.5 lac matters were reported of kidnapping in 5 years, most of which did not demand extortion but was for marriage purpose.</p>

          <h3 class="b2">Rape is a much broader term to be defined and its scope is of wider perspective. It is the most common crime against women and the Indian society and system has failed to end this heinous crime.
            The world is seeing India as a nation of rapists. The numbers have increased tremendously. The law system has failed purely.
             The offence can be categorized in various aspects as a rape of a minor girl, rape of a woman (Sec 376), rape with murder (Sec 376A), rape in families, rape by public servants (Sec 376C) ,
              gang-rape (Sec 376 D), marital rapes (Sec 376B). The punishments for these offences range from imprisonment upto 7yrs to 20 yrs or Life imprisonment and also fine.</h3>
